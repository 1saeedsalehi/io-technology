## How can I contribute with a blog?

One of the most used forms of sharing knowledge on the iO tech_hub is writing blogs. You might already have an idea of what you want to write about. Generally, blogs on the iO tech_hub are not too long. It’s a collection of bite-size content that inspires people. Here are some tips and “rules” when contributing with a blog:

- All content is written in English
- You write the article from your point of view (e.g. “I find that…` instead of “We find that”)
- When making a summary of points, use lists for readability
- Try to make your article visual, images, screenshots and diagrams of what you are writing about are great to add
